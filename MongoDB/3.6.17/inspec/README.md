# mongodb-enterprise-advanced-stig-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of MongoDB Enterprised Advanced 3, against [DISA](https://iase.disa.mil/stigs/)'s **MongoDB Enterprise Advanced 3.x Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) Version 1, Release 1**.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __ssh__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Running This Profile

    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/mongodb-enterprise-advanced-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t ssh://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --reporter cli json:<filename>.json

Runs this profile over ssh to the host at IP address <hostip> as a privileged user account (i.e., an account with administrative privileges), reporting results to both the command line interface (cli) and to a machine-readable JSON file. 
    
    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/mongodb-enterprise-advanced-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t ssh://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --reporter cli json:<filename>.json
    
Runs this profile over ssh to the host at IP address hostip as a privileged user account (i.e., an account with administrative privileges), reporting results to both the command line interface (cli) and to a machine-readable JSON file.

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
