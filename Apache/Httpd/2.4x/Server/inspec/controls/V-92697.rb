    # httpd -V | egrep -i 'httpd_root|server_config_file'

    Verify that the \"Timeout\" directive is specified to have a value of
\"10\" seconds or less.

    # cat /<path_to_file>/httpd.conf | grep -i \"Timeout\"

    If the \"Timeout\" directive is not configured or is set for more than
\"10\" seconds, this is a finding.
