    In a command line, run \"httpd -M | grep -i ssl_module\".

    If the \"ssl_module\" is not found, this is a finding.

    Determine the location of the \"HTTPD_ROOT\" directory and the
\"httpd.conf\" file:

    # httpd -V | egrep -i 'httpd_root|server_config_file'
    -D HTTPD_ROOT=\"/etc/httpd\"
    -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE=\"conf/httpd.conf\"

    Search for the \"SSLCACertificateFile\" directive:

    # cat /<path_to_file>/httpd.conf | grep -i \"SSLCACertificateFile\"

    Review the path of the \"SSLCACertificateFile\" directive.

    Review the contents of <'path of SSLCACertificateFile'>\\ca-bundle.crt.

    Examine the contents of this file to determine if the trusted CAs are DoD
approved.

    If the trusted CA that is used to authenticate users to the website does
not lead to an approved DoD CA, this is a finding.

    NOTE: There are non-DoD roots that must be on the server for it to
function. Some applications, such as antivirus programs, require root CAs to
function. DoD-approved certificate can include the External Certificate
Authorities (ECA) if approved by the AO. The PKE InstallRoot 3.06 System
Administrator Guide (SAG), dated 08 Jul 2008, contains a complete list of DoD,
ECA, and IECA CAs.
